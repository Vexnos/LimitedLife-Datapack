# Limited Life
This is a Limited Life datapack created by myself, inspired by Grian's Limited Life series. 
Go check it out if you haven't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzaIHdjLIyM

For a player size of 4 or above, I recommend a worldborder cap of 700 for the best experience.

To start the game, run `/function limitedlife:install` with everyone online then run `/function limitedlife:start`.
To pause your sessions (timers) run `/function limitedlife:end`, use `/function limitedlife:resume` to resume the timer.

If a player joins late, run `/function limitedlife:addnewplayers`.

This current version of Limited Life has the Boogeyman implemented. The Boogeyman was introduced in Season 2 of Third Life known as Last Life.
To start the Boogeyman, run `/function limitedlife:boogeyinit`. If the Boogeyman fails to kill before the end of the session, run `/function limitedlife:boogeyfail` (Note: automating the fail function is not possible with a datapack as far as I know)
